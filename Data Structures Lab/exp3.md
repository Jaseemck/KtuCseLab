Question:
Implementation of Queue, DEQUEUE and Circular queue using arrays  

Solution:
*What is Queue?
Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology, i.e., the data item stored first will be accessed first.

Refer to the program!
