Question:
Implementation of binary trees using linked lists and arrays- creations, insertion, deletion and traversal

Solution:
A complete binary tree is a binary tree where each level ‘l’ except the last has 2^l nodes and the nodes at the last level are all left aligned. Complete binary trees are mainly used in heap based data structures.
The nodes in the complete binary tree are inserted from left to right in one level at a time. If a level is full, the node is inserted in a new level.
